## 🎯 Key Concepts at a Glance

### Core Innovation: Semantic Embedding-Based Classification
```
Old Way:
  Search for keywords → "Kubernetes" → Architecture
  Problem: Ignores context, brittle

New Way:
  Convert to AI embedding → Compare meaning → Architecture
  Benefit: Understands context, flexible, intelligent
```

### The 7-Stage Enterprise Pipeline
```
📝 Raw Text
  ↓ [1] Break into sentences (unique IDs)
  ↓ [2] Convert to semantic embeddings
  ↓ [3] Detect mixed sentences (multiple topics)
  ↓ [4] Split mixed into clauses
  ↓ [5] Prevent duplicates (registry)
  ↓ [6] Use context if unclear
  ↓ [7] Merge into coherent paragraphs
📊 Structured, Quality-Assured Output
```

### Enterprise Guarantees
```
✅ ZERO Duplication     (Enforced by SentenceRegistry)
✅ No Data Loss         (All content preserved)
✅ Semantic Intelligence (Uses embeddings, not keywords)
✅ Coherent Output      (Professionally-written paragraphs)
✅ Self-Improving       (Expert training mode)
✅ Quality Assured      (Comprehensive metrics)
✅ Context-Aware        (Uses surrounding sentences)
```
